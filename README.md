# AMP Music Player
The Ambient Music Player is a music player that simultaneously plays audio and video. It is intended for playing quiet background music with ambient nature clips.\
**Features:**
* Audio
    * Play MP3 files
    * Select a custom music directory
    * Shuffle collection
* Video
    * Play MP4, MKV or TS files
    * Shuffle collection
    * Open custom video URL
* Other
    * Convert non-native video files
    * 'Clean Console' mode

## NOTE:
This program was originally designed to come with many small 15-45 second nature clips, but due to copyrights and overall lack of high qualitiy videos, this will not be possible. The current plan is to have the user submit a premade compilation/livestream *or* place their own clips in the *./media* directory. If you know of a site that will provide high-quality, free and short clips, please email me at Jake_Guy_11@protonmail.ch
    
**Dependencies:**
* FFMpeg
* FFPlay
* Youtube-dl (optional)

There are currently no releases, it is still a WIP existing only as a java program. Standalone release expected very soon.
